This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It's a clock, made entirely with CSS-in-JS. I built it just to teach myself JSS, but you can check it out too, if you'd like.

## To Start

1. Clone the repo
2. `cd` to the folder
3. `npm install`
4. `npm start`
5. Cloq will begin running on localhost:3000

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
